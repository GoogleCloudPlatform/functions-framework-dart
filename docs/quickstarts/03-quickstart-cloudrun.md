# Quickstart: Cloud Run

This quickstart discusses how to build and deploy a function using
[Cloud Run], a serverless platform on [Google Cloud].

The instructions in this quickstart can be run from a terminal on your own
machine or from [Cloud Shell], an online development and operations environment,
using the [Cloud Shell Editor].

Using the [Cloud Shell Editor] is beyond the scope of this quickstart, but
this [codelab] can help you get started.

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisites are to have a Google Cloud project ID and the Cloud
SDK (`gcloud`) installed and configured (authenticated) on your machine.

### Set up your Google Cloud project

Go to the [project selector] page. Select an existing or create a new
project. **Note your project ID for later.**

Creating a new project is highly recommended because you can destroy all
resources when you're finished just by deleting the project.

Make sure that billing is enabled for your project ([see how]).

### Set up the Cloud SDK (gcloud)

Install and configure [gcloud].

If you need help installing or configuring `gcloud` on your machine, see
[Quickstart: Getting started with Cloud SDK][quickstart]. Don't forget to run
the `gcloud auth login` command to authenticate your terminal.

> Note: `gcloud` is preinstalled in [Cloud Shell].

### Set your gcloud project

Update your `gcloud` configuration to use your project ID.

```shell
$ gcloud config set core/project <PROJECT-ID>
Updated property [core/project].
```

## Get a copy of the `hello` example

Clone this repo or download a [zip] archive and extract the contents. Change
directory to `examples/hello`.

## Build and deploy with a single command

Using the new `gcloud beta run deploy` command, you can now build and deploy
your function in a single step.

```shell
gcloud beta run deploy NAME \
  --source=PATH` \         # can use $PWD or . for current dir
  --project=PROJECT \      # the Google Cloud project ID
  --region=REGION  \       # ex: us-central1
  --platform managed \     # for Cloud Run
  --allow-unauthenticated  # for public access
```

Since the project ID was saved to the `gcloud` configuration in the
[Set your gcloud project](#set-your-gcloud-project) section, you can also do the
same for platform and region and omit the arguments from the command line.

> For Cloud Run, the platform must be set to `managed`.
> For a list of regions, run `gcloud compute regions list`.

```shell
gcloud config set run/platform managed
gcloud config set run/region us-central1
```

For example:

```shell
$ gcloud beta run deploy hello --allow-unauthenticated --source=.

```

<br>

**Congratulations!** You have successfully built and deployed your function
to Cloud Run. You can now access your function at the Service URL that is
printed in the last line of output.

If you prefer not to use this beta command for now, read on. The next two
sections cover building and deploying in two separate steps.

## Build the container image using Cloud Build

[Cloud Build] is a fully serverless continuous integration / continuous delivery
(CI/CD) platform for [Google Cloud]. Instead of building the image on your own
machine, you can use `gcloud` to upload the project to Cloud Build. Cloud Build
knows how to build Docker images and save them to an image repository in the
container registry associated with your project.

Use the project ID that you selected (see the Prerequisites section for setting
up your project):

```shell
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
export IMAGE_NAME=helloworld
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE_NAME
...
```

Upon success, you will see a SUCCESS message containing the image name.

## Deploy the function to Cloud Run

```shell
gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/$IMAGE_NAME --platform managed
```

1. You will be prompted for the service name: press Enter to accept the default
   name, helloworld.
1. You will be prompted for region: select the region of your choice, for
   example `us-central1`.
1. You will be prompted to allow unauthenticated invocations: respond `y`. Then
   wait a few moments until the deployment is complete. On success, the command
   line displays the service URL.

Visit your deployed function by opening the service URL in a web browser.

**Congratulations!** You have successfully deployed your function to Cloud Run!

## Clean up

Cloud Run does not charge when the service is not in use. However, you might
incur charges while the image is still stored in the Container Registry.

You can either just [delete the image] or delete the entire project (which will
free up all resources and stop any other charges from incurring) from
the [Manage resources] page.
