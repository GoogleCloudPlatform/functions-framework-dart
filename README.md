An open source FaaS (Function as a Service) framework for writing portable Dart
functions, brought to you by the Google Dart and Cloud Functions teams.

The Functions Framework lets you write lightweight functions that run in many
different environments, including:

- Your local development machine
- [Google Cloud Run] - see [quickstart]
- [Google App Engine]
- [Knative]-based environments

[Google Cloud Functions] does not currently provide an officially supported Dart
language runtime, but we're working to make running on [Google Cloud Run] as
seamless and symmetric an experience as possible for your Dart Functions
Framework projects.

The framework allows you to go from:

[examples/hello/lib/functions.dart]
```dart
import 'package:functions_framework/functions_framework.dart';
import 'package:shelf/shelf.dart';

@CloudFunction()
Response function(Request request) => Response.ok('Hello, World!');
```

To:

```shell
curl https://<your-app-url>
# Output: Hello, World!
```

All without needing to worry about writing an HTTP server or request
handling logic.

See more demos under the [examples] directory.

## Features

- Build your Function in the same container environment used by Cloud Functions
  using [buildpacks]
- Invoke a function in response to a request
- Automatically unmarshal events conforming to the [CloudEvents] spec
- Portable between serverless platforms

## Quickstart

[Dart quickstart] on your local machine.

```shell
$ cd examples/hello
$ docker build -t app .
...

$ docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name demo --rm app
Listening on :8080
```

In another terminal...

```shell
$ curl localhost:8080
Hello, World!
```
